# startpage in docker ansible role

- Should works on every distro
- Require Docker and docker-py installed on your machine.
- This role will pull and run my personal [startpage](https://hub.docker.com/r/lacsap/startpage/) in a container listening on port 8114.
- This is my personal startpage and probably of no interest to anyone else.
